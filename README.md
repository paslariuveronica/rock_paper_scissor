# Vanilla HTML, CSS, JS template for GitHub Classroom Home Assignments

This is a simple template that allows easy startup of vanilla HTML, CSS, JS code inside a development server using [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/).

The purpose of this template is to allow easy initialization of [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/) home assignments which can be easily opened in [Stackblitz Codeflow](https://stackblitz.com/codeflow/beta).

## Usage (for students)

Just create your static files inside the `public` directory.

If you want to run the dev server `npm install` the dependencies and `npm start`.

## Usage (for teachers)

When creating home assignments make sure you select the option to start from a template repository and search for `PaulNegoescu/TEMPLATE-html-css-js-vanilla`.

To check home assignments in Stackblitz just go to the pull request of the home assignment using the button in GH Classroom, then replace `github.com` in the URL with `pr.new` and hit enter.

Alternatively look at installing the [CodeflowApp Bot](https://developer.stackblitz.com/codeflow/integrating-codeflowapp-bot) then use the button to open the PRs.

Alternatively (fastest way to access a project) use my (yet unpublished) Chrome plugin to provide a button in GH Classroom that does this.
